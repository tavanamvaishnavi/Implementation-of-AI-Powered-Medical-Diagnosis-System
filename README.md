# Implementation-of-AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-System
The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System is an intelligent tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing medical conditions based on user input or symptoms. This system uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze medical data and provide potential diagnoses or recommendations.

The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly, scalable, and reliable AI system that can enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide valuable insights to doctors, clinicians, and healthcare providers.
